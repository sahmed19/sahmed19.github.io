## BLOOMPUNK: Environment Set Dress & Lighting
*Unity*

Bloompunk is a unique hybrid of first-person shooter and roguelike games set in a vibrant world of animated plants.

I led a team of 7 3D artists as technical art director to produce assets in a consistent style for the game. I also set dressed, lit, and did environmental visual effects for the game environment.
