I love working on game tools and making the development process as creativity focused as possible (especially 3D art).

I'm a USC graduate currently residing in California, although I am originally from Portland, OR.

In my free time, I like to consume many different kinds of media, like books, television, films, and... games, of course. Oh, and going on runs! As Sakurai says, "it's better for developers to exercise at least a little."

### TOP MEDIA

* Console game: *Ocarina of Time*
* Handheld game: *Professor Layton and the Unwound Future*
* Television drama: *Better Call Saul*
* Anime: *Hunter x Hunter*
* Film: *Spirited Away*
